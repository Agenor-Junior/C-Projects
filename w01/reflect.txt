1. I have previous experience in programming from this course, in the C language. Although I failed on the first attempt due to never having programmed before, having gone bad at the beginning of the last course and having taken a while to assimilate the content, at the end of the course I was able to understand the discipline and I believe that the result of grades did not reflect my real learning. I believe that I failed for some specific things, and that will not be repeated in this course.

2. The compilation of a text file in C language to an executable file is a process in which the source file is converted into instructions for the computer and goes through some steps, such as pre-processing, in which the compiler processes the directives that begin with '#' before the main function. Afterwards, the code is compiled, assembled in machine language and linked to the necessary libraries, both in the C language and in the operating system, in order to be able to run. Then it's ready to run.

3. My objective in this course is to improve my knowledge in the C language and be able to move on to the next course.
