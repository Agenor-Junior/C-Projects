1. Although it is possible to use all 3 types of iterations to build loops, each one has its own characteristics. The Do While loop ensures that the loop is executed at least once. while While Loop is mainly used when the result is not known, but the condition needs to be checked at the beginning of the loop. The For Loop is mainly used when you need to control the loop termination condition.
In the specific case of arrays, the For Loop is generally the most used loop to access the elements of each array value and perform the necessary logic and calculations. In this workshop it was important to create loops for sums of values, to be able to select the priority for the user and check if it was possible to accept financing and then display the message “financing option available on some items”.


2. Generally, I build code in parts and test that up to this point it is behaving as expected. For syntactical errors I use the VS code debugger to find the line where the error is and correct the error.
For semantic errors, I usually use some "printf" to evaluate whether variables or an expression are having the output I expect. When a loop or expression doesn't display the output I expect, I check the documentation online to find and fix the error.


3. Upon receiving this message, the first step I take is to check the 2 files generated by the compiler output.txt and output_master.txt and compare the lines, spaces and values if they are exactly the same.
Then I see which line and character (column) is indicating the error, and what is printed in the file generated from the output I executed. After checking where the errors are, I open VScode and make the necessary corrections and try a new workshop submission. In the case of the example shown, it was not a program error, but rather a value entered incorrectly by the user, so just restart and type correctly.
